# Title: Choosing App Type 
## Status: 
Proposed 

## Context:
The team is faced with the decision of selecting an appropriate app type for the transportation application. The options considered are native, web, or hybrid. Each option has its advantages and drawbacks, and the team needs to make an informed decision based on the project's requirements, development resources, and long-term maintenance considerations. 

## Decision:
After careful consideration, the team proposes to go with a **Hybrid App** approach, combining elements of both native and web development. This decision is motivated by the following reasons:

- **Cross-platform:** The need for cross-platform compatibility, enabling the app to reach a broader audience on both iOS and Android devices. Additionally, a hybrid approach allows for code reusability, reducing development time and efforts.
- **Incorporate with geolocation services:** For ride booking and tracking in this application, this app needs to be incorporative with geolocation services, and hybrid app supports.

## Consequences:
- **Performance:** May not match the performance of fully native apps, but advancements in hybrid frameworks have significantly narrowed the gap.
- **Access to Device Features:** While not as seamless as native development, hybrid apps can still access device features through plugins, striking a balance between native and web capabilities.

# Title: Selection of Database Schema for Transportation App

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
In the process of designing the database schema for the transportation application, the team faces the critical decision of selecting a suitable database solution to store user profiles, ride history, and payment information. Key considerations include ensuring data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Decision:
After careful analysis, the team proposes to use a **relational database management system** for storing user-related data. The team chooses **PostgreSQL** as a preferred database solution for the following reasons:

- **Robust Features:**
  PostgreSQL is famous for its robust feature set, including advanced indexing, complex data types, and comprehensive query optimization. All these features relate to the diverse data structures and queries expected in this transportation app.

- **Scalability:**
  The scalability feature of PostgreSQL is well-documented, making it a good choice to accommodate the potential growth of the app. As user numbers increase and data expands, the scalability feature can be leveraged to maintain optimal performances.

- **User Experience:**
  PostgreSQL implements asynchronous processing for non-critical tasks to avoid delays in user interaction. It optimizes data retrieval by designing queries to fetch only the necessary data, providing a great user experience.

## Consequences:

- **Initial Setup Complexity:**
  PostgreSQL has a complex initial setup compared to some other database solutions. This complexity could cause delays in the development process.

- **Potential Migration Efforts:**
  Committing to PostgreSQL may introduce challenges if there are significant changes in the database technology landscape or if the project requirements evolve in a way that necessitates a change in the underlying database technology.

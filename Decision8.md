# Title: Integration of Stripe and PayPal for Payment Gateway

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The development team is tasked with integrating a payment gateway into the mobile app for a modern transportation company. This decision involves evaluating different payment gateway options based on security, ease of use, supported regions, and transaction fees.

## Decision:
Stripe and PayPal will be evaluated for integration into the mobile app, with the final selection based on a balance of security, ease of use, regional support, and transaction fees. This decision is motivated by the need to provide users with secure and convenient payment transactions while considering the specific requirements of the transportation company. More reasons:

- **Security Features:**
  Both Stripe and PayPal offer robust security features, including encryption and fraud prevention, simplifying the implementation of secure payment transactions.

- **User Experience:**
  Integrating well-established payment gateways enhances the user experience by providing familiar and trusted payment options.

## Consequences:

- **Integration Complexity:**
  While Stripe and PayPal have comprehensive documentation, integrating multiple payment gateways may introduce some complexity. The team must carefully manage the integration process to ensure seamless transactions.

- **Transaction Costs:**
  Transaction fees and costs associated with each payment gateway need to be carefully evaluated and monitored to optimize expenses and maintain cost-effectiveness.

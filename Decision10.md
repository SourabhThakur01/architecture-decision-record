# Title: Integration of Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Push Notifications

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The development team is tasked with incorporating a push notification system into the mobile app for a modern transportation company. This decision involves selecting a push notification service provider that supports both iOS and Android platforms and offers features like personalization and message targeting.

## Decision:
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) will be integrated as the push notification service for the mobile app. This decision is motivated by FCM's ability to support both iOS and Android platforms, as well as its features for personalization and message targeting. FCM's integration aligns with the transportation company's goal of efficiently notifying users about ride confirmations, driver updates, and important announcements. More reasons behind this decision are:

- **Cross-Platform Support:**
  FCM simplifies the development process by providing a unified solution for push notifications on both iOS and Android platforms.

- **Feature Set:**
  FCM's features for personalization and message targeting enhance the effectiveness of push notifications, allowing the transportation company to deliver relevant and timely information to users.

## Consequences:

- **Learning Curve:**
  There may be a learning curve for developers who are new to FCM. However, Firebase provides comprehensive documentation and resources to facilitate the integration process.

- **Dependency:**
  The app's dependency on FCM means that any changes or disruptions to the Firebase service could impact the delivery of push notifications. Regular monitoring and contingency planning will be necessary.

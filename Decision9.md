# Title: Implementation of Email/Password and Social Login for Authentication

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The development team is tasked with implementing a secure authentication system for a mobile app designed for a modern transportation company. The decision involves choosing authentication mechanisms for both drivers and passengers. Considerations include security, user convenience, and adherence to industry best practices.

## Decision:
The team decides that the mobile app will implement a combination of **email/password authentication** and **social login mechanisms**. This decision is made to strike a balance between security and user convenience. Email/password authentication ensures a secure and traditional login method, while social login options such as Google and Facebook enhance user experience by providing a convenient and familiar way to sign in. More reasons:

- **User Convenience:**
  Social login options simplify the onboarding process, making it more convenient for users to sign up and log in using their existing social media credentials.

- **Security:**
  Email/password authentication provides a robust and well-established security mechanism, ensuring the protection of user accounts.

## Consequences:

- **Implementation Complexity:**
  Integrating both email/password and social login mechanisms may introduce some complexity in the authentication process. The team must carefully manage the implementation to ensure a seamless and secure user experience.

- **User Education:**
  While social login is convenient, some users may be unfamiliar with or cautious about linking their social media accounts. Clear communication and education about the security measures in place will be essential.

# Title: Selection of UI Framework for Transportation App

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The team is tasked with choosing a UI framework for the transportation app, considering specific requirements outlined for geolocation services, real-time tracking, map interfaces, payment transactions, authentication, data storage, push notifications, and security. The decision must align with the project's goals and the need for a seamless user experience in a transportation context.

## Decision:
After thorough evaluation and consideration of project requirements, the team has decided to adopt **React Native** as the UI framework for the transportation app. Another option considered was Flutter. Like React Native, Flutter allows the development of cross-platform applications from a single codebase. However, React Native was chosen for the following reasons:

- **Development Efficiency:** Given the complexity of the transportation app, React Native's component-based architecture and the ability to hot-reload during development contribute to increased efficiency. This is vital for meeting tight deadlines and adapting to evolving requirements.

- **Integration with Native Modules:** React Native allows seamless integration with native modules, enabling the utilization of device-specific features. This is crucial for incorporating geolocation services and real-time tracking effectively.

## Consequences:
- **Performance Trade-off:** While React Native offers satisfactory performance, it may not match the performance of fully native solutions. However, the team believes that the advantages in development speed and cross-platform compatibility outweigh this trade-off.

- **Dependency on Native Modules:** The reliance on native modules for geolocation and real-time tracking means that updates and changes in these modules should be closely monitored to ensure compatibility with the React Native framework.

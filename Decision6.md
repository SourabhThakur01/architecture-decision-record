# Title: Adoption of Google Maps for Geolocation Services

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The team has the task of creating a mobile app for a transportation company, and the decision at hand involves selecting a geolocation service provider. Key considerations include accuracy, coverage, and cost-effectiveness to enable features like ride booking and tracking.

## Decision:
After considering all the factors, the team decides to adopt **Google Maps** as the geolocation service provider for the mobile app. This decision is driven by the platform's extensive global coverage, high accuracy, and comprehensive feature set. Leveraging Google Maps' APIs will facilitate the seamless integration of geolocation services into the app, meeting all the requirements of the transportation company. More reasons to take this decision are:

- **Integration:**
  Google Maps' well-documented APIs and extensive developer resources will simplify the integration process. The team can benefit from a widely used and supported mapping service, reducing development time and effort.

- **User Experience:**
  Users will enjoy a familiar and user-friendly mapping interface, enhancing their experience with features such as interactive maps, accurate location data, and a rich set of functionalities.

## Consequences:

- **Cost Management:**
  While Google Maps offers a robust set of features, careful monitoring of API usage will be crucial to manage associated costs effectively. The team must implement measures to optimize API calls and control expenses.

- **Dependency:**
  The app's reliance on Google Maps means that any changes to the pricing model, terms of service, or the discontinuation of certain features by Google could impact the app. Regular monitoring and flexibility in the codebase will be necessary to adapt to any changes.

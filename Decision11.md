# Title: Implementation of Security Measures

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The development team is responsible for fortifying the security of a mobile app for a modern transportation company, given its handling of sensitive user information and transactions. This decision encompasses the implementation of various security measures, with a particular emphasis on adopting Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure communication over networks.

## Decision:
**Transport Layer Security (TLS) Implementation:**
TLS will be implemented to secure the communication between the mobile app and the server. This decision is motivated by the need to encrypt data in transit, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of user information during transmission. The implementation of TLS and encryption techniques enhances data protection, instilling user confidence in the app's security.

## Consequences:

- **Implementation Complexity:**
  Proper implementation of TLS and encryption techniques requires careful consideration and testing, adding a layer of complexity to development.

- **User Experience:**
  Striking a balance between security measures and a seamless user interface may require careful design decisions to avoid negatively impacting the user experience.

# Title: Implementation of WebSocket for Real-time Location Updates

## Status: 
Proposed

## Context:
The development team has received a new task of creating a mobile app for a modern transportation company. A crucial aspect is the real-time tracking of drivers and passengers, necessitating a decision on the technology for establishing continuous connections between the app and the server.

## Decision:
After thorough analysis, the team decides to implement **WebSocket** to establish a real-time connection between the mobile app and the server for seamless location updates. This decision is motivated by WebSocket's ability to provide bidirectional communication with low latency, making it well-suited for real-time applications. The adoption of WebSocket aligns with the goal of delivering timely and accurate location information to enhance the user experience. More reasons behind this decision are the following:

- **Real-time Updates:**
  WebSocket's bidirectional communication will enable real-time updates of driver and passenger locations, contributing to a smoother and more responsive user experience.

- **Efficiency:**
  The implementation of WebSocket simplifies the process of maintaining persistent connections, reducing the overhead associated with frequent polling for updates.

## Consequences:

- **Scalability:**
  As the user base grows, ensuring the scalability of WebSocket connections may become challenging. The team must implement proper measures to handle increasing loads and maintain performance.

- **Resource Usage:**
  WebSocket connections can consume server resources, and careful monitoring is required to manage resource usage efficiently and prevent potential bottlenecks.
